Title: About 

### Ewald Enzinger
 
I work as a Senior Research Engineer at Eduworks Corporation, a small research and development firm in Corvallis, Oregon. My interests include speech recognition, speaker verification, speech synthesis, natural language processing, and machine learning. I completed a PhD in Electrical Engineering at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia. My research focused on speaker recognition and its application in forensic voice comparison. I previously held research appointments at the Acoustics Research Institute of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. My doctoral dissertation *Implementation of forensic voice comparison within the new paradigm for the evaluation of forensic evidence* has been described as "a remarkable and significant step forward in the field ... [that] represents one of the strongest research advancements in this domain to date."
